# Fine-tuned BERT Sentiment Classifier
A custom sentiment analysis model based on BERT, fine-tuned on domain-specific data for improved performance.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis using custom data. The model is built using Hugging Face's Transformers library and is specifically tuned for [your specific domain/use case].

## Model Architecture
- Base Model: bert-base-uncased
- Number of Labels: 2 (binary classification)
- Additional Layers: Classification head with dropout

## Dataset
- Training Data: [Description of your training data]
- Validation Split: 80/20 train/test split
- Data Format: CSV/JSON [specify your format]
- Sample Distribution:
  - Class 0: X examples
  - Class 1: Y examples

## Training Details
